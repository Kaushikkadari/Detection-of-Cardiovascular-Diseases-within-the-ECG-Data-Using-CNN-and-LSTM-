This is a binary file and cannot be directly edited in text format. Instead, you would need to create this image using an image editing software or a diagram tool and save it as a PNG file.

For the CardioDetect application, this file would contain a diagram showing the CNN-LSTM neural network architecture with:

1. Input layer showing ECG signal
2. Multiple CNN layers with filters
3. LSTM layers showing temporal processing
4. Dense layers for classification
5. Output layer showing binary classification (normal vs. abnormal)

The diagram would use color coding to distinguish different types of layers and include arrows showing the data flow through the network.
